# Recommender-System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System repository!

This project focuses on building an efficient and accurate movie recommender system using item-based collaborative filtering. 
The system analyzes user-item interactions to establish item-item similarity, generating personalized movie recommendations for users. 
The MovieLens dataset is used for training and evaluation, and Python with Pandas and NumPy is employed for data handling and analysis. 
The project's objective is to provide valuable insights into real-world recommender system challenges and showcase the implementation of item-based collaborative filtering. 
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and share feedback to improve the system further. 
Happy Recommending!
